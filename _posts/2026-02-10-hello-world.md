This blog is live. That's the first milestone.

I'm Nick, a public agency attorney in California, and I've been spending a lot of my time building things with AI — RAG applications, custom software with Claude Code, small experiments combining embeddings and local LLMs, and whatever else catches my attention on a given week.

I decided to start writing about it. Not polished tutorials or thought leadership — just honest notes about what I'm building, what's working, what isn't, and what I'm learning along the way.

Right now I'm working on a document relevancy sorting system for California Public Records Act requests, combining embeddings, local small LLMs, and query expansion techniques. More on that soon.

For now: the blog exists. Forward progress.
